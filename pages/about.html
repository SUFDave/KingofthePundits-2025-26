    <article class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title underlined">Competition Overview</h3>
      <p>King of the Pundits is a competitive football prediction league where six skilled predictors battle across two divisions over a 30-week season. Each participant makes weekly predictions across multiple football leagues, earning points based on the accuracy and difficulty of their picks.</p>
      <p>The competition spans matches from the Premier League, Championship, League One, and League Two, focusing exclusively on Friday through Monday fixtures to maintain competitive balance and ensure all participants have equal access to team news and information.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title underlined">How It Works</h3>
      <p><strong>Points System:</strong> Participants earn points based on prediction difficulty - Home wins are worth 1 point, Away wins earn 2 points, and correctly predicting a Draw awards the maximum 3 points.</p>
      <p><strong>Weekly Format:</strong> Each week, players select three matches - one they predict will be a home win, one for an away win, and one they believe will end in a draw. This format tests both analytical skills and risk management.</p>
      <p><strong>Picking Order:</strong> The selection order rotates weekly based on current league standings, with lower-placed players choosing their matches first. This system provides strategic balance and keeps the competition dynamic throughout the season.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title underlined">Competition Structure</h3>
      <p><strong>Division One:</strong> Currently features Davo, Mike, and Dylan competing for the top prizes and ultimate bragging rights.</p>
      <p><strong>Division Two:</strong> Ben, Dave K, Alex, and Myles battle for division supremacy and the coveted promotion spot to Division One.</p>
      <p><strong>Promotion & Relegation:</strong> At season's end, the top Division Two performer earns promotion to Division One, while the bottom Division One player faces relegation, ensuring competitive integrity across both divisions.</p>
